📜 FULL WEBSITE CREATION PROMPT

Objective:
Create a multi-page romantic website dedicated entirely to my girlfriend using HTML, CSS, and Python (Flask). The website should be beautifully designed with animations and transitions, and allow me to upload images to her gallery dynamically via the browser. No login is required — this is a private, local-use or Firebase/Heroku-hosted project.

⸻

🔧 Tech Stack:
	•	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind or custom)
	•	Backend: Python 3 + Flask
	•	Storage: Images uploaded via form and saved in /static/uploads
	•	Optional: Bootstrap or AOS.js for animations
	•	Hosting: Localhost (or Replit, Heroku, Firebase with Flask)
